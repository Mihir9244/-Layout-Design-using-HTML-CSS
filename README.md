# -Layout-Design-using-HTML-CSS
This layout illustrates a basic webpage structure using div tags in HTML and CSS. The design is organized into distinct sections: a header, navbar, section, aside, article, and footer. Each section is styled with a unique background color for visual separation. The header stands out in bold red, the navbar in bright orange, the section in soft beige, the aside in a pale yellow, the article in light blue, and the footer in striking black.
